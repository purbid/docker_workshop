#Pushing images to docker hub.
Once a docker file is ready, we can push it to Docker Hub for others to use(Public repository) or have it for ou own personal use(Private repository).
 We first have to sign-up on Docker Hub.
 Type ‘docker login’ to do this.
 And then tag the desired images and then upload them to the registry created on docker hub.
