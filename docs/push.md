#Pushing images to docker hub.
Once a docker file is ready, we can push it to Docker Hub for others to use(Public repository) or have it for ou own personal use(Private repository).
 We first have to sign-up on Docker Hub.
 Type ‘docker login’ to do this.
 And then tag the desired images and then upload them to the registry created on docker hub.

 After the image is tagged we'll do 
 
 ```
 docker push <img>
 ```
 to push the image to the docker hub.
